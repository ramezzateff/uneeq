# 🔐 Vulnerability Assessment Report

## 📋 Overview
- This project focuses on conducting a **Vulnerability Assessment** on a local network/web application to identify potential security risks.
- The assessment was carried out using industry-standard tools such as **Nmap**, **OpenVAS**, and **Nessus**.
- The goal is to detect vulnerabilities, categorize them based on severity, and propose effective mitigation strategies.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Nmap** – Network discovery and port scanning

---

## ⚙️ Methodology

1. **Information Gathering**
   - Identified target IP ranges, domain names, and services.
   - Mapped the network/web architecture.

2. **Scanning & Enumeration**
   - **Nmap** used for initial port scanning and service enumeration.

3. **Vulnerability Analysis**
   - Analyzed scan results to identify misconfigurations, outdated software, and known vulnerabilities (CVE-based).

4. **Risk Categorization**
   - Classified vulnerabilities using the **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)**:
     - 🔴 **Critical** (CVSS 9.0 – 10.0)
     - 🟠 **High** (CVSS 7.0 – 8.9)
     - 🟡 **Medium** (CVSS 4.0 – 6.9)
     - 🟢 **Low** (CVSS 0.1 – 3.9)

5. **Mitigation Planning**
   - Suggested fixes for each vulnerability based on industry best practices.

## 🛡️ Mitigation Strategies

1. **Patch Management**  
   Regularly update all systems, applications, and plugins.

2. **Network Hardening**  
   - Disable unnecessary ports/services.  
   - Implement strict firewall rules.

3. **Secure Configurations**  
   - Enforce strong SSL/TLS settings.  
   - Remove sensitive information from HTTP responses.

4. **Web Application Security**  
   - Use **input validation** and **prepared statements** to prevent SQL Injection.  
   - Implement **Content Security Policy (CSP)** and **Web Application Firewalls (WAF)**.

5. **Continuous Monitoring**  
   Set up automated vulnerability scans and real-time threat monitoring.

## 📖 Conclusion
This vulnerability assessment provided valuable insights into potential security gaps within the target network/web application. Addressing the identified vulnerabilities will significantly improve the system's overall security posture. Continuous monitoring and regular assessments are recommended to maintain a robust security environment.
